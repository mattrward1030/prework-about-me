    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am a student, currently enrolled at Penn LPS taking the Full Stack Flex coding bootcamp. Excited to be starting
      this journey into the world of coding and eager to see where it will take me.</p>
    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I'm from South Jersey, just outside the wonderul city of Brotherly Love, Philadelphia.</p>
    <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
    <p>Of course coding, and all the studying that comes along with it. I have a thirst for knowledge and programming
      does not dissapoint. Spending time with my son and watching him grow everyday is the biggest joy in my life, there
      is nothing like being a father and it is truly amazing. I love watching just about all sports, I am a diehard
      Eagles and Flyers fan and enjoy watching the Sixers and Phillies as well. During quarantine I've taken interest in
      going on hikes and exploriing the outdoors as much as I can, it's a great escape from being stuck inside and its
      something I hope to expand on in the future. </p>
    <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
    <p>To be a computer programmer and create exciting and innovative websites and applications. I love tackling real
      world problems with technology and I'm hoping that this leads me to great heights in this industry.</p>
    <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
    <p>Refer to the where I'm from section...I know, how thrilling</p>
    <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
    <p>This goes back to my answer in what is my dream job and really leans on two big things i love in life. I've
      always been enthralled by technology and what it can do for mankind to progress us forward. Secondly, I have
      always been someone who looks at really just about anything and thinks to myself, how can i make it better,
      whether
      it be an entirely new idea or expanding and improving on what currently exsist. To me these two things seem to
      mesh
      together perfectly and it is my hope that I can take what I learn and apply my skills to tackling issues and
      enhancing them. </p>
